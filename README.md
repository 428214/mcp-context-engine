# MCP Context Engine

Model Context Protocol (MCP) for context orchestration between users, tools and
Large Language Models (LLMs), focused on reducing hallucinations and improving
prompt reliability.

## 🎯 Purpose
This project explores the use of a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** as a
dedicated layer for **context engineering**, separating decision logic and
context management from raw prompt construction.

## 🧠 Motivation
Large Language Models often produce unreliable responses due to missing,
inconsistent, or poorly structured context. This project demonstrates how an
explicit context orchestration layer can improve control, consistency, and
transparency when interacting with LLMs.
